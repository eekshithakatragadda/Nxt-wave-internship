# Echo Podcast Website

I built the **Echo Podcast** application following the provided guidelines and further enhanced it with additional user-focused features. JavaScript was used at some parts to implement dynamic elements such as updating the bottom music player and enabling smooth interactive behaviors across the application.

Beyond the core requirements, I added a personalized **“For You”** section, a **Downloads** feature for offline podcast listening in the Home Page and a **daily reminder system** in the settings page to help users stay updated with new podcast releases. These enhancements aim to create a more engaging and user-centric podcast experience.

> **Note:** For the best visual experience on desktop, a screen zoom level of **67%** is recommended.
